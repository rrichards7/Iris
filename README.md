# Deep Neural Network (DNN) for Iris Dataset

Ryan J. Richards

Machine Learning using TensorFlow 1.8

## 1. Introduction/Methodology

This readme page will discuss how flowers contained within the Iris dataset are classified with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using TensorFlow's high level APIs for Python. This is my broken down and "linear" version of TensorFlow's example located here: https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/premade_estimators

## 2. Code

This section will break down and dicuss each section of the code in further detail.

### 2.1 Import Libraries

Import the following libs:

 ```python
#imports
from __future__ import absolute_import
from __future__ import division
from __future__ import print_function

import tensorflow as tf
import pandas as pd
```


### 2.2 Dataset

#### 2.2.1 Understanding the Iris Dataset

There are many other resources online regarding this dataset that will explain in the features/labels, point of the experiment, etc in more detail but here is a quick breakdown. The training and testing dataset is arranged as follows: first 4 columns are features (Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Pedal Length, Pedal Width) and the 5th (last) column is the label column (Iris species). The table below illustrates this:


| Sepal Length  | Sepal Width   | Pedal Length  | Pedal Width | Species|
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:|:-------------:|-------------:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
