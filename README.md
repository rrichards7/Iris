# Deep Neural Network (DNN) for Iris Dataset

Ryan J. Richards

Machine Learning using TensorFlow 1.8

## 1. Introduction/Methodology

This readme page will discuss how flowers contained within the Iris dataset are classified with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using TensorFlow's high level APIs for Python. This is my broken down and "linear" version of TensorFlow's example located here: https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/premade_estimators

## 2. Code

This section will break down and dicuss each section of the code in further detail.

### 2.1 Import Libraries



### 2.2 Download/Parse Dataset



### 2.3 Select Model Type




### 2.4 Train the Model




### 2.5 Evaluate/Test the Model



### 2.6 Predictions



### 2.7 Visualization using TensorBoard



## 3. Conclusion
